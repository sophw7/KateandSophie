  slicing strings --- simmilar to .substring
  print (var[#:#])
  this will print the variable text and the index of numbers desired to be returned 
    ex s = hello world
    print(s[1:3]) ---- this will print el.  -> the last index is not included (ALWAYS)
  --slice from start bc you cant start from 0
        print([:#]
