Strings
  len() - length of string - simmilar to .length
  checking if words are in strings - print(" " in text) 
    ex print ("words" in text) 
      this is simmilar to for each in java
    using not - dont use ! 
    
    check if something is not in text - print("" is not in text) 
    
  slicing strings --- simmilar to .substring
  print (var[#:#])
  this will print the variable text and the index of numbers desired to be returned 
    ex s = hello world
    print(s[1:3]) ---- this will print el.  -> the last index is not included (ALWAYS)
  --slice from start bc you cant start from 0
        print([:#]
        ex---- v = hippo
          print(:4])----- this will return hipp
   ---slicing to the end will be simmilar to start
        print([#:])
        
   slicing one character in the middle of string 
   Negative Indexing 
          -------this will start the index from the right
      given word 
      print([-#(length of string): -#(position of number + 1])
      
      
 modifying strings 
  upper()
 you will include your variable name with a dot 
 print var.upper()
 ---ex b = happy
      print b.upper()
  lower()
    print var.lower()
    
  removing whitespace (extra space before or after text that is not needed)
    strip()
   print var.strip()
      
      index visualization
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 | P | y | t | h | o | n |
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1

out of range error means that the index is too large for the acutal string


LECTURE NOTES
----------------
- single quotes cannot be used if there is an apostrophe
- lists
--------[0,0,0,0]
--------can have multiple types [50,"hello"] <- cannot sum everything in list

-loops
----for var in list():
-------print()


var = #
for somenum in my_list:
  sum = sum + somenum
- lists can have multiple types 
- cannot add lists together of different types 

- functions 
----  def somelist()
- def will define the function 
-sum list ([3,4,5])


def sum_a_list(list)
 sum = 0
 for number in list:
  sum = sum + sum_num
return sum


  if you want all sums to be printed you need to store values 
  store1= sum_a_list([list])
  store2 = sum_a_list([list2])
  print(store1)
  print(store2)
  
  
  input 
  name = input("Please enter your name: "
  print(name)
  
  number_in = int(input())
  
  
  conditionals 
  user_age = int(input())
  if user_age >= 25:
    print("You can rent a car affordably")
elif user_age < 25 and user_age >= 21:
  print("You can print a car, but its expensive")
else:
  print("You may not be able to rent!")
  
word = input()
if word.lower() < "mudkip":
  print("It comes after mudkip in the dictionary")
else: 
  print("It comes before")
uppercase or lowercase
